# VGG deep neural network compression

Study of SVD (sin) and CUR factorization methods for compression of VGG models and their comparison with the original deep neural networks of VGG in image classification problems

## Datasets

The evaluation is performed on standard data sets for the task of classifying images according to the accuracy metric for VGG-11

MNIST (train 60 000 / test 10 000)

CIFAR-10 (train 50 000/ test 10 00)
